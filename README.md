# Speech to Text Conversion using MFCC Audio Extraction and ConvNets in Keras

To add your own data to test,

Create a folder ```data``` in the root directory of this project. Inside this folder, add your labelled .wav files into separate folders.

Eg: -

```data
        tree
            .wav files of tree being uttered
        moon
            .wav files of moon being uttered
```



To run the code,

    ``` python speech_classification.py ```
